# proj_manager ðŸ’–

This is a simple project manager, which gives you data about your project, to help you know  your project better.

It's written in Rust.

I write this project to practise Rust programming.

For I'm a beginner to Rust, there must be some naive code, please don't hesitate to point it out :joy:.

## Get binary!

### Windows

Go to the release page, download the latest exe.

### Other

Clone this project and build it yourself. This project hasn't got any dependencies, so no worry.

## How to use

Create a config file in your local project root, named "proj_config".

Open the binary in your project root(where your proj_config file is), you'll see:

```
proj_manager v0.1.0, open source under GNU General Public License v3.0.
See: https://github.com/ice1000/proj_manager
Load success.
```

You can type 'help' to get help(the content is different in versions):

```
Commands:
data           -- print the meta data stored in the cofiguration file.
ls             -- print all the files.
exit           -- exit project manager.
help           -- print this doc.
line           -- see how many lines of code is here in your project.
```

You can see how many lines of code is here in your project:

```

You can customize the it's behavior by editing the cofiguration file:

```
ign:Cargo.lock
ign:.idea
ign:.git
ign-sfx:exe
name:your project name
```

key|value
:---|---:
ign|ignore files with given name
ign-sfx|ignore files with given suffix
name|you project name
